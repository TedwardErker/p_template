* COMMENT From "Ten simple rules for structuring papers" http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/17/088278
Konrad Kording and Brett Mensh





** Table 1: A summary of rules and their uses
|     | Rule                                              | Sign it is violated                                                         |
|-----+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1: | One big idea                                      | Readers cannot give one-sentence summary                                    |
|  2: | Humans as audience                                | Readers do not ‘get’ the paper                                              |
|  3: | Context, Contents, Conclusion                     | Readers ask why something matters or what it means                          |
|  4: | Optimize logical flow                             | Readers stumble on a small section of the text                              |
|  5: | Abstract: Compact summary of paper                | Readers cannot give the ‘elevator pitch’ of your work  after reading it     |
|  6: | Introduction: Why the paper matters               | Readers show little interest in the paper                                   |
|  7: | Results: Why the conclusion is justified          | Readers do not agree with your conclusion                                   |
|  8: | Discussion: Preempt criticism, give future impact | Readers are left with unanswered criticisms/questions on their mind         |
|  9: | Time allocation                                   | Readers find data clearer than the ultimate message                         |
| 10: | Iterate the story                                 | The paper’s contribution is rejected by test readers, editors or reviewers. |
